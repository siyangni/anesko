# Sliding Scale Filter Investigation Summary

## Issue Investigated
The "Sliding Scale Only" checkbox filter in the Royalty Analysis page was showing no data when checked, leading to empty tables and plots.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Data Conversion Bug in Migration Script**
**Problem**: The migration script used incorrect logic to convert sliding scale values:
```r
# INCORRECT (was converting "0"/"1" to NA)
sliding_scale = as.logical(as.character(sliding_scale))
```

**Original Data**: 
- 187 records with `sliding_scale = "0"` (no sliding scale)
- 838 records with `sliding_scale = "1"` (has sliding scale)

**Result**: All values were converted to `NULL/NA` in the database instead of `FALSE/TRUE`.

### 2. **Database State Before Fix**
```
sliding_scale | count
-------------|-------
NULL         | 1,007
```
**Result**: No records with `sliding_scale = TRUE`, so the filter returned no results.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Migration Script Conversion Logic**
**File**: `scripts/migration/03_import_data.R`
```r
# CORRECTED conversion logic
sliding_scale = case_when(
  sliding_scale == 0 | sliding_scale == "0" ~ FALSE,
  sliding_scale == 1 | sliding_scale == "1" ~ TRUE,
  is.na(sliding_scale) ~ NA,
  TRUE ~ NA
)
```

### 2. **Re-ran Migration with Fixes**
- Fixed foreign key constraint violations by filtering for valid book_ids
- Handled integer overflow in upper_limit values
- Successfully migrated 1,007 royalty tier records

### 3. **Enhanced UI Feedback**
**File**: `shiny-app/modules/royalty_analysis_module.R`
- Added informational message when sliding scale filter is active
- Improved user feedback about filter state

## Results After Fix

### Database State After Fix
```
sliding_scale | count | percentage
-------------|-------|------------
FALSE        | 175   | 17.4%
TRUE         | 832   | 82.6%
```

### Filter Functionality Verification
✅ **Without sliding scale filter**: Returns 998 records (all royalty data within year range)
✅ **With sliding scale filter**: Returns 832 records (only sliding scale books)
✅ **Data analysis**: `analyze_royalty_patterns` works correctly with sliding scale data
✅ **UI feedback**: Shows informational message when filter is active

## Expected Behavior Now

### When "Sliding Scale Only" is Unchecked:
- Shows all royalty tier data (~998 records for 1860-1920 range)
- Includes both sliding scale and fixed rate books
- Summary statistics reflect all books

### When "Sliding Scale Only" is Checked:
- Shows only books with sliding scale royalty structures (~832 records)
- Blue info box appears: "Filtering for books with sliding scale royalty structures only."
- Summary statistics reflect only sliding scale books
- Tier analysis shows patterns specific to sliding scale contracts

## Data Insights Revealed

The corrected data shows that **82.6% of books had sliding scale royalty structures**, which is historically significant and indicates that:
- Sliding scale royalties were the dominant contract type in this period
- Publishers commonly used tiered royalty rates based on sales volume
- The filter now provides meaningful analysis of this important contract structure

## Files Modified

1. **`scripts/migration/03_import_data.R`** - Fixed sliding scale conversion logic
2. **`shiny-app/modules/royalty_analysis_module.R`** - Enhanced UI feedback
3. **Created migration fix script** - `fix_sliding_scale_migration.R`

## Testing Completed

- ✅ Database migration with corrected conversion logic
- ✅ Foreign key constraint handling
- ✅ Query functionality with and without sliding scale filter
- ✅ Data analysis functions with sliding scale data
- ✅ UI feedback and user experience

The sliding scale filter now works correctly and provides valuable insights into the historical prevalence and structure of sliding scale royalty contracts in American publishing during 1860-1920.
